# ASU-CSE545-Software Security
This course will provide students with an understanding of the theories, tools, and techniques to
identify, exploit, and mitigate software security vulnerabilities in the network, binary, and web
levels. Students will study, in-depth, vulnerability classes to understand how to protect software
and how to secure software. We will also cover the history of software security, and ethical
considerations. This course will focus on a hands-on approach: In addition to understanding
vulnerability classes, students will be required to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
 
Specific topics covered include:
  
- History of Software Security
- Software Security Ethics
- Network Security
- Application Security
- Web Security 

earners will be able to:
 
- Identify the differences between bugs and vulnerabilities. 
- Explain the difficulties inherent in software security.
- Discuss the adversarial mindset as an approach to software security.
- Determine the historical and modern necessity for software security.
- Propose ethical issues inherent in software security.
- Evaluate and apply adversarial mindset to setuid binaries and challenges.
- Analyze, design and prototype a web server backdoor.
- Differentiate between ethical and unethical behavior in regards to identifying and exploiting
security vulnerabilities.
