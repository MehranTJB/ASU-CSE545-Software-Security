## Binary Hacking

The goal of this assignment is to break a series of x86_64 binaries using your full range of hacking skills that you have developed during this course. You will use the command-line skills that you developed in the Bandit assignment. You will need to analyze binary behavior, identify vulnerabilities, and create exploits that prove you can control the applicationâ€™s behavior.
