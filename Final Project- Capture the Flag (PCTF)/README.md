## PCTF - Capture the Flag

The goal of your project is to develop an awesome tool that will help you win the PCTF. This could be an automated exploitation tool, a network-defense tool, a binary-protection tool, or anything else that you imagine. Review the documents and videos on the PCTF Game Play, these will help you to gain an understanding of the PCTF environment. In addition, you will form teams, and learn to collaborate with your teams throughout the course to develop your project and compete in the PCTF.
